### Day 16 Dijkstra + State transfer machine

Prove:

1. Each vertex in the shortest path is enqued in the order of the shotest path itself.
2. Any equivalent cost path is enqued once.
3. Once a vertex is relaxed, the path is already in **current** optimal status, this status will be settled when poped from the priority queue.

### Day 22 Monkey Market

Through trial, I have given up the multithreading apporach due to time insufficient. I think the reason might be the cache missing in the competitive occupation among threads.

### Day 24 Crossed Wires

## üìÜ TODOs

- [x] Change day 3 algorithm to [regular expression](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript) implementation ([C++ 11 feature](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex)).
- [x] What is day 13 algorithm trying to testify?
- [ ] Building java repo.
- [ ] Construct the project to a CMake test project.
- [ ] Add cache to Dijkstra in Day 21 solution.
- [ ] ~~Add A*algorithm to Day 16 solution.~~ Nah, A* algo is not suitable for penalty shortest path problem.
- [ ] Change Day 20 distance calculation to Manhattan distance.
- [ ] Github issue at: [13110](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cpptools/issues/13110)
- [ ] Time efficency: Mutex > future async > single thread algorithm (VSCode debugger will try tracking the allocation variable data, thus recursive algorithm will be slowed down severely).
- [ ] Time efficency: Fixed size array > linked list > bucket> ... > ; stack variable > heap variable
- [ ] VSCode tracking memory of big HashMap/unordered_map cost extremely massive amount of time, execute the program manually.
- [ ] Change all dijkstra algorithm to static DP implementation instead of state machine path record within the node in queue.
- [ ] I think there might be a way to transform top-down memoization recursion (topological sort of the transpose) to bottom-up DP (reverse topological sort), and also to heuristic search? But I haven't figured out how. (See Introduction to Algorithms Ch 15 and 2023 Java Day12).
